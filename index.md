## Welcome to my domain

Hi! My name is Julia Sarun. I am in SWEN.101.03S2 and studying software engineering. I come from New York City and went to Brooklyn Technical High School. I chose this major because I took have experience with coding and enjoyed it, so I wanted to continue working with it. I chose software engineering and not computer science because I struggled with most of my science classes and did not want to suffer through 5 more years of it, even if I got to work with technology. In my free time, I enjoy playing games with my friends, playing ukulele, and solving puzzles. My favorite food is garlic bread ![Image](
